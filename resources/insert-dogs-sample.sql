She has food aggression, due to being starved at one point in her life, but we are confident that time and trust will resolve this.<br>Adora is an independent girl with no separation anxiety. She loves the company of humans and most dogs.<br>You might not be able to tell from her smiley face that Adora has actually gone through alot. We hope that after all she had suffered, she can find a place she can call home soon.<br>",

  "It has been a heartbreaking December for our latest rescue, Chester, who was found with maggots crawling out of the wounds on his head and ears. He was found to be shaking his head from the discomfort and pain he was experiencing. Thankfully, our volunteers were able to gain his trust and were able to bring him to the vet to get his wounds checked and cleaned.<br>We are happy to say that Chester is now on the road to recovery and is looking for a home to call his own. Chester is a very sweet boy who is good with people and loves jogging. He is so impressive, he even manages to keep pace!<br>He is estimated to be about 2 to 3 years of age and is sterilized. He loves his food, goats milk and gets along with humans and calm dogs.",

  "Don't let his name fool you, Viking is anything but a seafaring voyager! His favourite destination is a patch of luscious, green grass where he can sprint around and put his boundless energy to good use. Because of this abundance of energy, Viking gets bored easily and will do well in a home where he can get a high level of daily interaction. He will also excel if he undergoes training that stimulates his mind, as he learns very quickly. During training, Viking is really eager to work, and coupled with his loose-hanging tongue, his antics will surely put a smile on your face!",
