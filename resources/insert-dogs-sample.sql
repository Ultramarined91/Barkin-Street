  "Adora is an absolute darling to take care of and she loves her food. She even takes her medicines without qualms! She has food aggression, due to being starved at one point in her life, but we are confident that time and trust will resolve this.<br>Adora is an independent girl with no separation anxiety. She loves the company of humans and most dogs.<br>You might not be able to tell from her smiley face that Adora has actually gone through alot. We hope that after all she had suffered, she can find a place she can call home soon.<br>",

Chester is a very sweet boy who is good with people and loves jogging. He is so impressive, he even manages to keep pace!<br>He is estimated to be about 2 to 3 years of age and is sterilized. He loves his food, goats milk and gets along with humans and calm dogs.",
